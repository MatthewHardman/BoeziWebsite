        <h2>John's Journey</h2>
        <p>
          John Boezi has spent over two decades developing products that matter. Starting with a passion for solving real-world problems, John has evolved from hands-on maker to strategic product developer, working with some of the world's most innovative companies and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          His experience spans from initial concept through manufacturing at scale, giving him a unique perspective on what it takes to bring a product from idea to successful market launch. John's philosophy is simple: understand the user deeply, design with integrity, and never compromise on quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not developing products, John can be found in the mountains, on the water, or in his workshop—staying connected to the adventurers, athletes, and builders who inspire his work.

  <section class="alt-bg">
    <div class="container" id="process">
      <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3rem;">Our Proven Process</h2>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto 3rem auto;">
        We've refined our approach through hundreds of successful projects. This methodology ensures nothing falls through the cracks and every product reaches the market ready to succeed.

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item fade-in-on-scroll">
          <h4>1. Discovery & Validation</h4>
          <p>
            We start by truly understanding your idea, market, and audience. We validate the concept, identify potential challenges early, and define clear success metrics. This stage is crucial—getting it right now saves time and money later.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Market research report, competitive analysis, product requirements document</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item fade-in-on-scroll">
          <h4>2. Concept Development</h4>
          <p>
            We explore multiple design directions, evaluate feasibility, and narrow to the strongest concept. This involves sketching, 3D modeling, basic prototyping, and user feedback sessions.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Concept CAD models, design rationale, feasibility assessment</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item fade-in-on-scroll">
          <h4>3. Detailed Design</h4>
          <p>
            Now we engineer the product to production quality. We handle material selection, structural optimization, manufacturability analysis, and prepare for tooling. Every detail is considered.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Production CAD files, engineering drawings, manufacturing specifications</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item fade-in-on-scroll">
          <h4>4. Prototype & Testing</h4>
          <p>
            We build functional prototypes and subject them to rigorous testing. Real-world testing identifies issues before production, and user feedback drives refinements. We iterate until performance is validated.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Functional prototypes, test reports, certification documentation</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item fade-in-on-scroll">
          <h4>5. Manufacturing Preparation</h4>
          <p>
            We select manufacturing partners, design tooling, establish quality processes, and run pilot production runs. We optimize for cost, quality, and timeline. Everything is tested before full production launch.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Manufacturing partner contracts, tooling designs, QC procedures, pilot run results</p>
